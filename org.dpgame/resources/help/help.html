	<h1>Design Patterns Game</h1>
<hr />		<p>Design Patterns Game aims to teach <b>Object Oriented Design Patterns</b> through 
puzzle solving. For each design pattern, there exists a corresponding puzzle type. A puzzle related to a pattern can be 
solved by applying the related design pattern. A pattern specific compiler checks the application of the pattern to the puzzle.</p>
	
	<p>The game consists of four basic components: a <b>board</b>, a <b>solution-box</b>, a <b>tool-box</b> and a <b>compiler message view</b>.</p>
	<br />

	<p><b>Tool-box</b> consists of tools  <img src="path4.jpeg" alt="path" width="25" height="30"/> to solve the puzzle. Each 
	tool in the tool-box has a unique identification number.</p>
	<p><b>Solution-box</b> is the area where the player programs the solution. The solution-box initially has one solution-area
	<img src="solutionarea.jpeg" alt="Solution area" width="25" height="30"/>. Solution-area is used for specifying the actions 
	that will be applied to a tool in the toolbox. So each solution-area must be associated to a tool in the tool-box using the
	tool's identification number. Add <img src="add.jpeg" alt="run"width="40" height="15"/> button can be used to add additional
	solution areas. Run <img src="run.jpeg" alt="run"width="40" height="15"/> button in the solution-box is used to run the created 
	solution.</p>
	<p><b>Compiler message view</b> is the area where the compilation errors are displayed. After the solution in the solution-box is 
	run by pressing the Run button, the puzzle compiler checks the solution for errors. If the solution does not comply with the 
	application of the pattern, the solution is not run and the compilation errors are viewed in the compiler message view. If the 
	solution is correct in terms of pattern rules, the solution is executed.</p>
	<p><b>Board</b> is the area where the solution of the puzzle is displayed. It consists of board objects. Basic board objects are 
	<b>catcher</b>	<img src="catcher.jpeg" alt="Catcher" width="15" height="15"/> and <b>target</b> 
	<img src="target.jpeg" alt="target" width="15" height="15"/>. There can be other <img src="fruit.jpeg" alt="fruit" width="15" height="15"/> 
	type of board objects depending on the puzzle. Catcher is a board object that can move on the board. Target is the object that catcher 
	tries to reach.</p>
	
	<p>The <strong>goal</strong> of the game is to find a solution with the tools in the tool-box that will carry catcher to target 
	on the board.</p>
	
	<p>For each type of puzzle, the rules of the game change depending on the design pattern. The pattern puzzles are:</p>
